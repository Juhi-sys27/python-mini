This project aims to help food lovers explore and analyze real-world restaurant data to discover the best-rated, most cost-effective, and cuisine specific dining options in their locality.
Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will uncover patterns in restaurant offerings, pricing, ratings, service availability, and geographical distribution. 
The end goal is to empower users with insights that can drive smarter food decisions based on factual data rather than personal recommendations.
